### More Info

This project was bootstrapped with [electron-forge](https://www.electronforge.io/templates/typescript-+-webpack-template) with the typescript and webpack template.

It was then extended with the [react-typescript framework integration](https://www.electronforge.io/guides/framework-integration/react-with-typescript)

Webpack was configured in order to structure the project files into mainProcess (electron codebase) and rendererProcess (react codebase) folders.
